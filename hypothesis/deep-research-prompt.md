# Google Deep Research Prompt: Mathematical Theorems for Stochastic Computing Formal Verification

I need comprehensive research on the mathematical theorems and proofs required to formally verify a stochastic computing system using Lean 4. This is for a project implementing stochastic arithmetic operations on FPGA hardware with a REPL interface.

## Research Objectives

### 1. Core Stochastic Computing Theory
- **Fundamental theorems** proving correctness of stochastic number representation
- How probabilities in bitstreams relate to numeric values
- Independence assumptions and their mathematical justification
- Theorems about random bitstream generation (LFSR properties)

### 2. Stochastic Multiplication (AND Gate)
- **Prove**: P(A ∧ B) = P(A) × P(B) for independent bitstreams
- Mathematical conditions for independence
- Error bounds and variance for finite-length bitstreams
- Correlation effects when streams aren't perfectly independent
- Theorems about accuracy convergence as bitstream length increases

### 3. Stochastic Addition (MUX-Based)
- **Prove correctness** of scaled addition: MUX(select, A, B) where select ~ Bernoulli(0.5)
- Expected value: E[result] = (P(A) + P(B)) / 2
- Variance and error propagation in MUX-based addition
- Alternative addition methods (if any) and their mathematical properties
- Unscaled addition approaches and their limitations

### 4. Error Analysis and Convergence
- **Concentration inequalities**: Hoeffding bounds, Chernoff bounds for bitstream accuracy
- How quickly does empirical probability converge to true probability?
- Error bounds as a function of bitstream length (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 bits)
- Central Limit Theorem applications to stochastic computing
- Cumulative error through chained operations (A × B × C, etc.)

### 5. Bitstream Generation
- **LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) mathematical properties**
- Theorems proving LFSR produces pseudo-random sequences
- Maximum-length sequences and their distribution properties
- Correlation between LFSR outputs at different taps
- Alternatives: True random number generation theorems

### 6. Comparison and Conversion Operations
- Converting between binary representation and stochastic bitstreams
- Theorems about bitstream-to-binary conversion accuracy
- Comparison operations in stochastic computing
- Magnitude estimation from bitstreams

### 7. Advanced Operations (if applicable)
- Division in stochastic computing (theoretical foundations)
- Exponentiation and other nonlinear operations
- Square root via stochastic methods
- Trigonometric functions in stochastic form

### 8. Lean 4 Formalization Considerations
- Similar formal verification projects in probability theory
- Existing Lean 4 libraries for probability (Mathlib components)
- How to represent bitstreams formally (lists, streams, probability spaces?)
- Inductive proofs vs. real analysis approaches
- Computable vs. non-computable proofs for hardware verification

## Specific Questions

1. What are the **minimum assumptions** needed to prove stochastic multiplication correctness?
2. How do **correlation and independence** affect accuracy - what theorems govern this?
3. What are the **tightest error bounds** achievable for finite bitstreams?
4. Are there **information-theoretic limits** to stochastic computing accuracy?
5. How should **probability spaces be constructed** in Lean 4 for bitstream verification?
6. What **existing Lean 4 proofs** in probability theory can be leveraged?
7. Are there **alternative mathematical frameworks** (measure theory, information theory) better suited for this?

## Desired Outputs

- List of key theorems with citations to papers/textbooks
- Proof sketches showing the logical flow
- Existing Lean 4/Coq/Isabelle formalizations of similar theorems
- Recommended probability theory foundations needed
- Specific Mathlib modules in Lean 4 that would be useful
- Known limitations or open problems in stochastic computing theory

## Context

This research will inform:
- Writing formal Lean 4 proofs for stochastic arithmetic correctness
- Establishing trust in FPGA hardware implementation
- Providing mathematical guarantees to REPL users
- Educational documentation about why stochastic computing works

## Key Papers to Include (if found)

- Original stochastic computing papers (1960s-70s)
- Modern stochastic computing surveys
- Formal verification of probabilistic systems
- Error analysis in stochastic computing
- LFSR mathematical properties
- Concentration inequalities applicable to bitstreams

Please provide detailed mathematical foundations with focus on what's provable in a theorem prover like Lean 4, emphasizing constructive proofs where possible.
