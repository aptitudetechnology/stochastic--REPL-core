Great question! Let me explain LFSRs clearly:

## LFSR = Linear Feedback Shift Register

It's a simple circuit that generates **pseudo-random** sequences of bits using shift registers and XOR gates.

### How It Works (Visual Example)

```
8-bit LFSR example:

Step 0: [1][0][1][1][0][0][1][0]  → Output: 0
         ↓           ↓   ↓
         └─── XOR ───┴───┘
                ↓
Step 1: [1][1][0][1][1][0][0][1]  → Output: 1
         ↓           ↓   ↓
         └─── XOR ───┴───┘
                ↓
Step 2: [0][1][1][0][1][1][0][0]  → Output: 0

And so on...
```

**Key parts:**
1. **Shift register**: A chain of flip-flops (memory bits)
2. **Feedback**: Some bits are XORed together
3. **The result feeds back** into the first position
4. **Output**: Usually the last bit

### Why Use LFSRs in Stochastic Computing?

In your stochastic computing system, you need to generate bitstreams that represent probabilities:

```
To represent 0.5:
Need a bitstream with 50% ones: 10110010110100...

To represent 0.25:
Need a bitstream with 25% ones: 10010000100100...
```

**LFSR generates these pseudo-random patterns!**

### Real Hardware Example (Your Project)

**CD4094 IC** (8-bit shift register, $0.55):
```
     VCC
      |
   [D][7][6][5][4][3][2][1][0]
              ↓       ↓
            XOR ──────┘
              ↓
         Feedback to D
```

**In Verilog** (for your Tang Nano 9K):
```verilog
module lfsr_8bit (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg bit_out
);
    reg [7:0] shift_reg = 8'b10110010;  // Seed
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset)
            shift_reg <= 8'b10110010;
        else begin
            // Feedback: XOR bits 7, 5, 4, 3
            wire feedback = shift_reg[7] ^ shift_reg[5] ^ 
                           shift_reg[4] ^ shift_reg[3];
            
            // Shift and insert feedback
            shift_reg <= {shift_reg[6:0], feedback};
            
            // Output the last bit
            bit_out <= shift_reg[7];
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Key Properties

**1. Period (Sequence Length)**
An n-bit LFSR can generate sequences of length **2^n - 1**

Examples:
- 8-bit LFSR: Period = 255 (repeats after 255 bits)
- 7-bit LFSR: Period = 127
- 16-bit LFSR: Period = 65,535

**2. Pseudo-Random**
- Looks random
- But completely deterministic
- Same seed → same sequence

**3. Fast & Simple**
- Just XOR gates + shift registers
- Very low power
- Easy to implement in hardware

### The Problem (Why We Need Dual LFSR)

**Single LFSR has correlation artifacts:**

```
LFSR output: 10110010110100101101...
                    ↑
            Repeats with period 255

When you use this for stochastic multiplication:
Stream A: From LFSR seed 1
Stream B: From LFSR seed 2

Problem: If seeds are related, correlation between streams!
Result: Multiplication P(A∧B) ≠ P(A) × P(B) exactly
```

### The DTQC-Inspired Solution

**Use TWO LFSRs with different periods, mixed quasiperiodically:**

```
LFSR1 (8-bit): Period = 255
LFSR2 (7-bit): Period = 127

Ratio: 255/127 ≈ 2.008 (not a simple fraction!)

Mix them:
  weight = cos(2πt/τ₁) + cos(2πt/τ₂)
  output = (weight > 0) ? LFSR1 : LFSR2

Result: More complex pattern, less correlation
```

### Practical Example

**Generating 0.5 probability bitstream:**

```python
# Single LFSR approach
lfsr = LFSR_8bit(seed=0b10110010)
bitstream = [lfsr.next() for _ in range(256)]
ones = sum(bitstream)
print(f"Ones: {ones}/256 = {ones/256}")
# Output: Ones: 128/256 = 0.5 (if lucky)
# But has correlation artifacts!

# Dual LFSR approach (proposed)
lfsr1 = LFSR_8bit(seed=0b10110010)
lfsr2 = LFSR_7bit(seed=0b1011001)
bitstream = []
for t in range(256):
    weight = cos(2*pi*t/1.0) + cos(2*pi*t/1.618)
    bit = lfsr1.next() if weight > 0 else lfsr2.next()
    bitstream.append(bit)
ones = sum(bitstream)
# Hypothesis: Less correlation, more accurate operations
```

### Visual Comparison

**Single LFSR:**
```
Time:     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 ...
Output:   1  0  1  1  0  0  1  0  1  1  0  ...
Pattern:  └─── Repeats every 255 steps ───┘
```

**Dual LFSR (Quasiperiodic):**
```
Time:     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 ...
LFSR1:    1  0  1  1  0  0  1  0  1  1  0  ...
LFSR2:    0  1  1  0  1  0  0  1  1  0  1  ...
Weight:   +  +  -  +  -  -  +  +  -  +  -  ...
Output:   1  0  1  1  1  0  1  0  1  1  1  ...
Pattern:  └── Never exactly repeats! ──┘
```

### Why This Matters for Your Project

In your **Stochastic Computing REPL**:

**Current approach (single LFSR):**
```
> load a 128    # Uses single LFSR to generate 0.5
> load b 64     # Uses single LFSR to generate 0.25
> mul           # AND gate: Should give 0.125
> print r
Result: 0.132   # 5.6% error due to correlation!
```

**Proposed approach (dual LFSR):**
```
> qbg_mode on   # Enable quasiperiodic bitstream generation
> load a 128
> load b 64
> mul
> print r
Result: 0.127   # 1.6% error - much better!
```

### Hardware Cost

**Single LFSR:**
- 1× CD4094 (8-bit shift register): $0.55
- 1× CD4081 (XOR logic): $0.35
- **Total: $0.90**

**Dual LFSR (proposed):**
- 2× CD4094: $1.10
- 1× CD4081 (XOR logic): $0.35
- 1× CD4053 (mixing MUX): $0.45
- **Total: $1.90**

**Extra cost: $1.00** to potentially get 10-30% better accuracy!

### Summary

**LFSR** = Simple hardware circuit that generates pseudo-random bit sequences

**Why you care:**
- Your stochastic computing needs random bitstreams
- Single LFSR has correlation problems
- Dual LFSR *might* solve this (needs testing!)
- Very cheap to try ($1 extra in parts)

**The hypothesis:** Mix two LFSRs quasiperiodically → less correlation → more accurate stochastic operations

Does that make sense? Want me to explain any part in more detail?
