# DTQC-QBG Unified Theory Hypothesis

## H₀: Unified Quasiperiodic Framework Hypothesis

**Quasiperiodic mixing with incommensurate frequencies improves computational processes across scales, from nanosecond hardware operations to multi-day optimizations, through a common mathematical mechanism of decorrelation and enhanced exploration.**

---

## H₁: DTQC Convergence Guarantee

**DTQC quasiperiodic annealing with golden ratio periods (τ₂/τ₁ = φ = 1.618...) converges to near-optimal solutions faster than standard simulated annealing by 15-30%, with convergence probability approaching 1 as optimization time T increases.**

### Formal Statement
```
∀ optimization problem H, ∀ target fitness F_target:
  P(DTQC_anneal(H, τ₁, φ·τ₁, T) ≥ F_target) ≥ 1 - exp(-c·T)
  
Where convergence time satisfies:
  T_DTQC ≤ T_standard · (1 - δ), with δ ∈ [0.15, 0.30]
```

### Testable Predictions
- [ ] MaxCut on random graphs (n=20): DTQC reaches 90% optimal in 20% fewer iterations
- [ ] Graph 3-coloring: DTQC finds valid coloring 25% faster than standard annealing
- [ ] QUBO problems: DTQC energy convergence rate 1.2-1.3× faster

---

## H₂: Phase Boundary Robustness

**DTQC protocol maintains quasiperiodic order and performance benefits when coupling strength J exceeds the phase boundary J_critical = ε/τ₁ + ε/τ₂, where ε is perturbation amplitude.**

### Formal Statement
```
∀ J > J_critical = ε/τ₁ + ε/τ₂:
  maintains_quasiperiodic_order(J, ε, τ₁, τ₂) = TRUE
  AND
  performance_improvement(J) ≥ 15%

∀ J < J_critical:
  performance_improvement(J) → 0 as J → J_critical⁻
```

### Testable Predictions
- [ ] For ε = 0.1, τ₁ = 24h, τ₂ = 24.84h: J_critical = 0.00833
- [ ] Systems with J > 0.01 show >15% improvement
- [ ] Systems with J < 0.005 show <5% improvement
- [ ] Performance degrades continuously as J approaches J_critical from above

---

## H₃: Multi-Scale Superiority

**Three-period DTQC protocols (τ₁, τ₂, τ₃) outperform two-period protocols by an additional 5-10% for optimizations lasting longer than the longest period, due to enhanced decorrelation from hierarchical incommensurability.**

### Formal Statement
```
For optimization duration T ≥ max(τ₁, τ₂, τ₃):
  
  F_three_period(T) ≥ F_two_period(T) · (1 + δ_multi)
  
Where:
  τ₁ = 24h (diurnal)
  τ₂ = 24.84h (circatidal) 
  τ₃ = 654.6h (solar rotation, 27.275 days)
  δ_multi ∈ [0.05, 0.10]
```

### Testable Predictions
- [ ] **30-day optimization**: Three-period beats two-period by ≥5%
- [ ] **7-day optimization**: Three-period shows no significant advantage (<2%)
- [ ] **Beat period**: Three-period system has beat period >6 months vs 29.5 days for two-period
- [ ] **Correlation**: Three-period autocorrelation ≤ 0.5 × two-period autocorrelation

---

## H₄: QBG Hardware Instantiation

**Quasiperiodic Bitstream Generation (QBG) using dual-LFSR mixing at clock frequencies (τ₁, τ₂) implements discrete-time DTQC at nanosecond scale, improving stochastic computing accuracy by 10-30% through reduced correlation artifacts.**

### Formal Statement
```
For stochastic bitstream of length L:
  error_QBG(L) ≤ error_single_LFSR(L) · (1 - 0.10)
  
Equivalently:
  L_QBG(target_error) ≤ L_single(target_error) · (1 - 0.20)
  (20-30% shorter bitstreams for same accuracy)
```

### Testable Predictions
- [ ] **Stochastic multiplication** (8-bit × 8-bit): QBG error 0.015 vs single-LFSR error 0.021 at L=256
- [ ] **Autocorrelation**: QBG lag-1 autocorr < 0.1 vs single-LFSR > 0.3
- [ ] **Beat period**: For τ₁=100 cycles, τ₂=162 cycles: beat = 26,100 cycles >> L
- [ ] **Power**: QBG adds <5% LUT overhead on FPGA

---

## H₅: Three-LFSR QBG Enhancement

**Three-LFSR QBG with hierarchical periods (100, 162, 273 clock cycles) outperforms two-LFSR QBG by 5-8% for bitstreams longer than 256 bits, paralleling DTQC's multi-scale advantage.**

### Formal Statement
```
For bitstream length L ≥ 256:
  error_3LFSR(L) ≤ error_2LFSR(L) · (1 - 0.05)

For bitstream length L < 128:
  error_3LFSR(L) ≈ error_2LFSR(L)  (no significant difference)
```

### Testable Predictions
| Configuration | L=128 | L=256 | L=512 | L=1024 |
|---------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Single LFSR   | 3.2%  | 2.1%  | 1.5%  | 1.1%   |
| Two-LFSR      | 2.9%  | 1.9%  | 1.3%  | 0.9%   |
| Three-LFSR    | 2.9%  | 1.7%  | 1.2%  | 0.8%   |
| **Improvement (3 vs 2)** | 0% | **11%** | **8%** | **11%** |

---

## H₆: Scale Invariance of Quasiperiodic Advantage

**The performance improvement from quasiperiodic mixing is scale-invariant: the same mathematical principles that yield 15-30% improvements in DTQC optimization (hour-day timescales) also yield 10-30% improvements in QBG hardware (nanosecond-microsecond timescales).**

### Formal Statement
```
Define scaling factor s = time_scale_ratio:

DTQC operates at: t ∈ [hours, days], s_DTQC ≈ 10⁴ seconds
QBG operates at:  t ∈ [ns, μs],      s_QBG  ≈ 10⁻⁶ seconds

Ratio: s_DTQC / s_QBG ≈ 10¹⁰

Hypothesis:
  improvement_DTQC / improvement_QBG ≈ 1 ± 0.3
  
I.e., relative improvements are similar despite 10-billion-fold time difference
```

### Testable Predictions
- [ ] If DTQC shows 20% improvement → QBG shows 14-26% improvement
- [ ] If QBG shows 15% improvement → DTQC shows 10.5-19.5% improvement
- [ ] Correlation: r² > 0.7 between DTQC and QBG improvement percentages across 10+ test problems

---

## H₇: Golden Ratio Optimality

**The golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618 is near-optimal for two-period quasiperiodic mixing, outperforming other irrational ratios (√2, √3, e, π) by providing maximal incommensurability per unit magnitude.**

### Formal Statement
```
Let τ₂/τ₁ = r (ratio)

Define "decorrelation efficiency" η(r) = 
  autocorrelation_reduction(r) / computational_cost(r)

Hypothesis:
  η(φ) ≥ η(r) for r ∈ {√2, √3, e/2, π/2, random_irrational}
```

### Testable Predictions
- [ ] φ = 1.618: autocorr = 0.08, cost = 1.0 → **η = 11.5**
- [ ] √2 = 1.414: autocorr = 0.12, cost = 1.0 → η = 8.3
- [ ] e/2 = 1.359: autocorr = 0.15, cost = 1.0 → η = 6.7
- [ ] π/2 = 1.571: autocorr = 0.10, cost = 1.0 → η = 10.0
- [ ] Golden ratio achieves ≥10% better η than next-best ratio

---

## H₈: Parameter Robustness

**DTQC and QBG performance is robust to ±1% perturbations in period ratios, maintaining >90% of optimal improvement, making practical implementation feasible without infinite-precision arithmetic.**

### Formal Statement
```
For optimal ratio r* (e.g., φ = 1.618):
  
∀ δ with |δ| < 0.01:
  improvement(r* + δ) ≥ 0.90 · improvement(r*)
  
∀ δ with |δ| < 0.05:
  improvement(r* + δ) ≥ 0.80 · improvement(r*)
```

### Testable Predictions
- [ ] τ₂/τ₁ = 1.608 to 1.628 (φ ± 1%): performance varies <10%
- [ ] τ₂/τ₁ = 1.57 to 1.67 (φ ± 3%): performance varies <20%
- [ ] Discrete approximations (e.g., 162/100 = 1.62) work nearly as well as exact φ
- [ ] FPGA fixed-point with 8 fractional bits is sufficient

---

## H₉: Adaptive Period Selection

**Optimal quasiperiodic periods scale with problem duration (DTQC) or bitstream length (QBG), following the rule: τ_optimal ∝ duration^(1/k) where k is the number of periods.**

### Formal Statement
```
DTQC: For optimization duration D days:
  τ₁ = 1 day (fixed)
  τ₂ = 1.035 days if D < 7
  τ₂ = 1.035 days, τ₃ = 27.3 days if 7 ≤ D < 180
  τ₂ = 1.035 days, τ₃ = 27.3 days, τ₄ = 365 days if D ≥ 180

QBG: For bitstream length L:
  τ₁ = 10 cycles, τ₂ = 16 cycles if L < 128
  τ₁ = 100 cycles, τ₂ = 162 cycles if 128 ≤ L < 512
  τ₁ = 100, τ₂ = 162, τ₃ = 273 cycles if L ≥ 512
```

### Testable Predictions
- [ ] Using L=256 periods for L=1024 bitstreams: 5-10% performance loss
- [ ] Using D=30-day periods for D=7-day optimization: 3-8% performance loss
- [ ] Adaptive selection outperforms fixed periods by ≥8% on average

## H₁₀: Formal Verification Completeness

**All DTQC protocol theorems (convergence, phase boundaries, multi-scale advantage) can be formally proven in Lean 4 with <5% of proofs remaining as `sorry`, establishing mathematical rigor comparable to cryptographic protocols.**

### Formal Statement
```
Let Γ = set of core DTQC theorems
  Γ = {convergence, phase_boundary, multi_scale_advantage, 
       golden_ratio_optimality, parameter_robustness}

∀ theorem T ∈ Γ:
  verified_lines(T) / total_lines(T) ≥ 0.95

AND ∃ proof path from axioms to all T ∈ Γ
```
