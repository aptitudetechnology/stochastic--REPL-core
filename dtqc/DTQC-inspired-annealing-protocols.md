Perfect! I've formalized DTQC-inspired annealing protocols in Lean 4. Here's what this captures:

## Core Protocols Defined

1. **Quasiperiodic Schedule**: Modulates the standard annealing schedule with two incommensurate frequencies
   - Exploits multifrequency nature of DTQCs
   - Creates complex exploration patterns

2. **Multi-Timescale Exploration**: Different system components evolve at different rates
   - Fast and slow modes operate simultaneously
   - Inspired by DTQC's multiple incommensurate responses

3. **Symmetry Breaking (ℤ₂×ℤ₂)**: Different qubit groups driven at different frequencies
   - Directly from the paper's ℤ₂×ℤ₂ DTQC phase
   - Useful for problems with natural groupings

## Key Principles Formalized

- **Robustness Criterion**: J > ε/τ₁ + ε/τ₂ (from the paper's phase diagram)
- **Incommensurability**: Using irrational ratios (like golden ratio φ) for τ₂/τ₁
- **Subharmonic Responses**: Frequencies at halves of linear combinations
- **Phase Boundaries**: When DTQC order exists vs. breaks down

## Practical Recommendations

The code includes concrete guidance for:
- **MaxCut**: Multi-timescale with golden ratio
- **Graph Coloring**: Symmetry-breaking for vertex groups  
- **QUBO**: Basic quasiperiodic with moderate perturbation
- **Protein Folding**: Multi-timescale for hierarchical structure

The implementation notes give practical parameters that respect the physics constraints from the paper!

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific protocol or add verification/simulation capabilities?
