# Revised Unified QBG-DTQC Hypothesis Framework
## Timeline-Agnostic Research Protocol

## Meta-Hypothesis: Analogous Cross-Scale Quasiperiodic Effects

**Quasiperiodic mixing with incommensurate frequencies may improve computational processes across vastly different timescales‚Äîfrom nanosecond stochastic arithmetic (QBG) to multi-day biological optimization (DTQC)‚Äîthrough mathematically analogous (though potentially mechanistically distinct) decorrelation mechanisms.**

**Key Principle**: This framework tests whether similar mathematical structures produce similar computational benefits across scales, NOT whether they represent the same physical mechanism. The domains may share mathematical properties while differing fundamentally in their underlying processes.

## Core Hypotheses (Ordered by Priority)

### **H‚ÇÅ: Bio-Temporal DTQC Validation** (Primary - Phase 1) üéØ

**Statement**: Quasiperiodic environmental forcing at biologically-relevant timescales (œÑ‚ÇÅ=24h solar, œÑ‚ÇÇ=24.84h lunar) improves optimization of circadian-coupled biological systems by ‚â•15% compared to static conditions, and this improvement specifically requires the 29.5-day beat period.

**Formal**:
```
Œº(solar+lunar) ‚â• Œº(static) √ó 1.15
p < 0.05, Cohen's d ‚â• 0.8
n = 40 per condition
```

**Experimental Design**: 280 optimization runs (7 conditions √ó 40 replicates)

**Conditions**:
1. **Static control** (no forcing) - baseline
2. **Solar only** (24h single period) - tests single-period resonance
3. **Lunar only** (24.84h single period) - tests lunar-specific effects
4. **Solar+Lunar aligned** (24h + 24.84h, correct beat) - PRIMARY TEST
5. **Solar+Lunar misaligned** (24h + 25.84h, disrupted beat) - tests beat period specificity
6. **Golden ratio** (24h + 38.8h) - tests biological specificity
7. **Random dual period** (24h + 27.3h) - tests against arbitrary dual forcing

**Critical Predictions**:
1. ‚úì Solar+Lunar_aligned > Static by ‚â•15%
2. ‚úì Solar+Lunar_aligned > Solar-only by ‚â•8%
3. ‚úì Solar+Lunar_aligned > Lunar-only by ‚â•8%
4. ‚úì Solar+Lunar_aligned > Solar+Lunar_misaligned by ‚â•5% (beat period matters)
5. ‚úì Solar+Lunar_aligned > Golden ratio by ‚â•5% (biological specificity)
6. ‚úì Solar+Lunar_aligned > Random dual by ‚â•5% (not just any two periods)
7. ‚úì Single periods (Solar, Lunar) show 5-10% improvement vs Static (resonance exists)
8. ‚úì Effect requires circadian coupling (H‚ÇÅ.‚ÇÇ)

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Strong rejection**: p ‚â• 0.05 OR improvement <5% for Solar+Lunar_aligned
- **Mechanism rejection**: No difference between aligned vs misaligned (beat period doesn't matter)
- **Non-specific**: Golden ratio or Random dual equal to Solar+Lunar (not biologically specific)

**Statistical Analysis**:
- One-way ANOVA across 7 conditions
- Post-hoc: Tukey HSD for pairwise comparisons
- Effect sizes: Cohen's d with 95% CI
- Multiple comparison correction: Holm-Bonferroni
- Report both corrected and uncorrected p-values

**Resources**: 
- Python + BioXen cyanobacteria ODE model
- Pre-registration on OSF before data collection begins
- Computational: 280 runs (parallelizable)

**Completion Criteria**: All 280 runs finished, statistical analysis complete, results interpretable

---

### **H‚ÇÇ: QBG Hardware Correlation Reduction** (Secondary - Phase 2)

**Statement**: Dual-LFSR quasiperiodic bitstream generation with golden ratio periods (œÑ‚ÇÇ/œÑ‚ÇÅ = œÜ = 1.618) reduces autocorrelation by ‚â•50% and improves stochastic computing accuracy by 10-30% compared to single-LFSR, as measured in both simulation AND actual FPGA hardware.

**Formal**:
```
autocorr_lag1(QBG) ‚â§ 0.5 √ó autocorr_lag1(single-LFSR)
error(QBG, L=256) ‚â§ 0.85 √ó error(single-LFSR, L=256)
Both conditions must hold in simulation AND hardware
```

**Test Application**: Stochastic multiplication (8-bit √ó 8-bit)

**Phases**:

#### Phase 2a: Simulation Baseline
**Conditions**:
1. Single LFSR baseline
2. Two-LFSR QBG (œÑ‚ÇÅ=100, œÑ‚ÇÇ=162 cycles)
3. Three-LFSR QBG (œÑ‚ÇÅ=100, œÑ‚ÇÇ=162, œÑ‚ÇÉ=273 cycles)

**Measurements** (n=100 trials per condition):
- Autocorrelation function (lag 0-50)
- Error rate vs sequence length (L=64, 128, 256, 512)
- Bitstream entropy rate

#### Phase 2b: FPGA Hardware Validation
**Platform**: Tang Nano 9K FPGA
**Implementation**: Verilog synthesis of 2-LFSR and 3-LFSR architectures

**Hardware Measurements** (n=50 per condition):
- Autocorrelation via captured bitstreams (‚â•10,000 bits)
- Error rates for stochastic multiplication
- Resource utilization (LUT count)
- Power consumption (if measurable)

**Critical Predictions**:
1. ‚úì **Simulation**: Autocorrelation QBG < 0.1, single-LFSR > 0.3
2. ‚úì **Simulation**: Error at L=256: QBG ‚âà1.7%, single ‚âà2.1% (19% reduction)
3. ‚úì **Hardware**: Autocorrelation reduction ‚â•40% (allowing 10% degradation vs simulation)
4. ‚úì **Hardware**: Error reduction ‚â•15% (allowing some degradation)
5. ‚úì **Hardware**: FPGA overhead <20% LUTs relative to stochastic core
6. ‚úì **Hardware**: No significant power consumption increase (<10%)

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Strong rejection**: Autocorrelation reduction <30% in simulation
- **Hardware failure**: Hardware results show <20% of simulation benefit
- **Cost failure**: FPGA overhead >25% OR power increase >20%

**Completion Criteria**: 
- Phase 2a: All simulations complete, autocorrelation and error metrics computed
- Phase 2b: Hardware implemented, measurements taken, simulation-vs-hardware comparison documented

---

### **H‚ÇÉ: Three-Period Superiority** (Exploratory - Phase 4)

**Status**: EXPLORATORY (not confirmatory)

**Statement**: Three-period quasiperiodic systems MAY outperform two-period systems by 5-10% when problem duration exceeds the longest period, but this is speculative and will only be pursued if H‚ÇÅ and H‚ÇÇ show large effect sizes (>20%).

**DTQC Version**:
```
For optimization duration T ‚â• 27.3 days:
fitness(œÑ‚ÇÅ=24h, œÑ‚ÇÇ=24.84h, œÑ‚ÇÉ=654.6h) ‚â• 
  fitness(œÑ‚ÇÅ=24h, œÑ‚ÇÇ=24.84h) √ó 1.05
```

**QBG Version**:
```
For bitstream length L ‚â• 256:
error(3-LFSR with œÑ‚ÇÅ=100, œÑ‚ÇÇ=162, œÑ‚ÇÉ=273) ‚â§
  error(2-LFSR with œÑ‚ÇÅ=100, œÑ‚ÇÇ=162) √ó 0.95
```

**Entry Criteria** (ALL must be satisfied):
- ‚úÖ H‚ÇÅ shows improvement >20% with p < 0.01
- ‚úÖ H‚ÇÇ shows improvement >20% with p < 0.01
- ‚úÖ Sufficient resources remain for additional testing

**Skip Criteria** (ANY triggers skip):
- ‚ùå Either H‚ÇÅ or H‚ÇÇ shows improvement <20%
- ‚ùå Either H‚ÇÅ or H‚ÇÇ has p > 0.01 (marginal significance)
- ‚ùå Resource constraints prevent additional experiments

**Test Design**:
- DTQC: 30-day vs 7-day cyanobacteria optimization (n=20 per condition)
- QBG: L=512 vs L=128 stochastic operations (n=100 trials)

**Exploratory Predictions** (hypothesis-generating, not confirmatory):
1. ? DTQC 30-day: 3-period MAY beat 2-period by ‚â•5%
2. ? QBG L=512: 3-LFSR MAY beat 2-LFSR by ‚â•5%
3. ? Short duration/length: expect no significant difference
4. ? Improvement MAY scale with duration/length ratio

**Analysis Approach**: 
- Report effect sizes with confidence intervals
- Do NOT claim confirmation even if p<0.05
- Treat as exploratory hypothesis generation
- Suggest follow-up studies if patterns emerge

**Completion Criteria**: 
- If pursued: All experiments complete, effect sizes reported with appropriate caveats
- If skipped: Document reasoning in results section

---

### **H‚ÇÑ: Mathematical Analogy Test** (Phase 3)

**Statement**: If quasiperiodic mixing benefits both domains through analogous mathematical mechanisms (decorrelation), then the relative improvement ratios should correlate across different problem types within each domain, even if absolute magnitudes differ between domains.

**Formal** (REVISED for scaling-adjusted analysis):
```
Within-domain correlation test:
- Test 5+ different problems in DTQC domain
- Test 5+ different problems in QBG domain
- Compute normalized improvement: imp_norm = imp / (duration/œÑ_beat)
- Within-domain correlation: r¬≤ > 0.6

Cross-domain similarity test:
ONLY if both domains show consistent improvements:
improvement_ratio = median(improvement_DTQC) / median(improvement_QBG)
0.8 ‚â§ improvement_ratio ‚â§ 1.25 (¬±20%)
```

**Interpretation Framework**:
- **Strong analogy** (r¬≤>0.6 within domains, ratio ‚àà [0.8,1.25]): Mathematical principles generalize
- **Weak analogy** (r¬≤>0.6 within domains, ratio outside [0.8,1.25]): Similar math, different magnitudes
- **Domain-specific** (low r¬≤ within domains): Each domain has unique mechanisms
- **No effect** (no improvements): Quasiperiodicity doesn't help computation

**Test Problems**:

**DTQC (5 biological systems)**:
1. Cyanobacteria growth optimization (primary, from H‚ÇÅ)
2. Synthetic circadian oscillator
3. Yeast cell cycle model
4. Plant photoperiod response
5. Mammalian sleep-wake cycle

**QBG (5 stochastic operations)**:
1. Multiplication (8-bit √ó 8-bit) (primary, from H‚ÇÇ)
2. Squaring (8-bit¬≤)
3. Division (8-bit √∑ 8-bit)
4. Square root approximation
5. Sigmoid function approximation

**Sample Size**: n=20 replicates per problem/operation (minimum)

**Critical Predictions**:
1. ‚úì Within DTQC: If cyanobacteria improves 20%, yeast should improve 15-25%
2. ‚úì Within QBG: If multiplication improves 18%, squaring should improve 13-23%
3. ? Cross-domain: Improvements MAY be similar magnitude (but not required for analogy)

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Weak analogy**: r¬≤ < 0.4 within either domain
- **No analogy**: Both domains show r¬≤ < 0.3

**Completion Criteria**: 
- All 10 problems/operations tested
- Correlation analysis complete
- Scaling relationships characterized

---

### **H‚ÇÖ: Golden Ratio Near-Optimality** (Phase 2 - Parallel with H‚ÇÇ)

**Statement**: For two-period systems with finite sequence lengths, the golden ratio œÜ ‚âà 1.618 should show near-optimal decorrelation efficiency due to its properties as the most poorly approximable irrational number. However, this optimality may be sequence-length dependent.

**Theoretical Basis**: 
- œÜ has continued fraction [1;1,1,1,...] (slowest rational convergence)
- This maximizes "irrationality" for avoiding resonances
- For finite L, optimality may shift to nearby rational approximations

**Formal**:
```
Define Œ∑(r) = autocorr_reduction(r) / computational_cost(r)
Œ∑(œÜ) ‚â• 0.95 √ó max{Œ∑(‚àö2), Œ∑(‚àö3), Œ∑(‚àö5), Œ∑(e/2), Œ∑(œÄ/2), Œ∑(F_n)}
(Near-optimal = within 5% of best)

where F_n are Fibonacci ratios: 13/8, 21/13, 34/21, etc.
```

**Test**: Systematic ratio comparison (n=5000 trials per ratio)

**Ratios to Test**:
- ‚àö2 = 1.414
- 13/8 = 1.625 (Fibonacci approximation)
- 21/13 = 1.615 (closer Fibonacci)
- **œÜ = 1.618034...** ‚Üê PREDICTED NEAR-OPTIMUM
- 34/21 = 1.619 (even closer Fibonacci)
- 162/100 = 1.620 (practical rational)
- ‚àö3 = 1.732
- œÄ/2 = 1.571
- e/2 = 1.359
- ‚àö5 = 2.236

**Sequence Lengths to Test**: L = 64, 128, 256, 512

**Critical Predictions**:
1. ‚úì œÜ achieves ‚â•95% of best observed decorrelation
2. ‚úì Simple rational approximations (162/100) perform within 2% of œÜ
3. ‚úì œÜ maintains ‚â•90% performance with ¬±2% perturbation (robustness)
4. ? Optimal ratio MAY shift with sequence length (e.g., Fibonacci approximations better at short L)

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Strong rejection**: œÜ performs <90% of best ratio
- **Weak rejection**: œÜ performs 90-94% of best (near-optimal not achieved)
- **Length-dependence**: Different L values have clearly different optimal ratios (œÜ not universal)

**Completion Criteria**: All ratios tested at all sequence lengths, near-optimality claim evaluated

---

### **H‚ÇÜ: Phase Boundary Robustness** (Phase 4 - DTQC-specific)

**Statement**: DTQC benefits require coupling strength exceeding a phase boundary where forcing periods couple strongly enough to system dynamics. Below this threshold, forcing is too weak to produce computational benefits.

**Theoretical Derivation** (CORRECTED for dimensional consistency):
```
For environmental forcing Œµ¬∑sin(2œÄt/œÑ·µ¢) coupled to system via parameter J:
- Forcing amplitude: Œµ (dimensionless, relative to baseline)
- Coupling rate: J (units: 1/time)
- Response timescale: 1/J
- Beat period: œÑ_beat = œÑ‚ÇÅœÑ‚ÇÇ/|œÑ‚ÇÇ-œÑ‚ÇÅ|

For forcing to influence system on beat timescale:
J¬∑œÑ_beat > Œµ/Œµ‚ÇÄ (dimensionless coupling strength)

where Œµ‚ÇÄ is the natural fluctuation scale of the system

For Œµ=0.1, Œµ‚ÇÄ=0.05, œÑ_beat=29.5 days:
J_critical = (Œµ/Œµ‚ÇÄ) / œÑ_beat = 2 / (29.5 days) = 0.0678 day‚Åª¬π
```

**Formal**:
```
‚àÄ J > 1.2√óJ_critical: improvement ‚â• 15%
‚àÄ J < 0.8√óJ_critical: improvement < 5%
Transition width: ¬±20% around J_critical
```

**Test**: Synthetic optimization problem with tunable coupling
- Sweep J from 0.02 to 0.15 day‚Åª¬π (10 values spanning predicted J_critical)
- n=20 replicates per J value
- Measure fitness improvement vs static control

**Critical Predictions**:
1. ‚úì Sharp transition near predicted J_critical
2. ‚úì Sigmoid-like response curve (not linear)
3. ‚úì Performance plateaus above 2√óJ_critical
4. ‚úì Below J_critical, performance ‚âà static control

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **No boundary**: Linear response across all J values
- **Wrong prediction**: Transition occurs at J > 2√ópredicted OR J < 0.5√ópredicted
- **No threshold**: Gradual improvement with no clear transition

**Entry Criteria**:
- H‚ÇÅ must be supported (otherwise no benefit to explain)
- Interest in mechanistic understanding remains high

**Completion Criteria**: 
- J sweep complete
- Phase transition characterized (or absence documented)
- Comparison to theoretical prediction

---

### **H‚Çá: Adaptive Period Selection Scaling** (Phase 4 - Exploratory)

**Status**: EXPLORATORY - post-hoc pattern analysis, not a priori prediction

**Statement**: Optimal periods MAY scale with problem characteristics following power law relationships, but this will be investigated retrospectively after H‚ÇÅ-H‚ÇÜ complete.

**Proposed Scaling Laws** (to be tested, not assumed):

**DTQC**:
```
D < 7 days:     œÑ = [24h, 24.84h]
7 ‚â§ D < 30:     œÑ = [24h, 24.84h, 654.6h]  
30 ‚â§ D < 180:   œÑ = [24h, 24.84h, 654.6h, 8766h]

Hypothesized relationship: 
optimal_œÑ_max ‚àù D^Œ± where 0.5 < Œ± < 1.5
```

**QBG**:
```
L < 128:        œÑ = [10, 16] cycles
128 ‚â§ L < 512:  œÑ = [100, 162] cycles
L ‚â• 512:        œÑ = [100, 162, 273] cycles

Hypothesized relationship:
optimal_œÑ_max ‚àù L^Œ≤ where 0.5 < Œ≤ < 1.5
```

**Analysis Approach**: 
- Compile all improvement data from H‚ÇÅ-H‚ÇÜ
- Search for scaling relationships via log-log regression
- Generate hypotheses for future dedicated study
- DO NOT claim confirmation (this is hypothesis-generating)
- Report as "patterns observed" not "laws established"

**Completion Criteria**: 
- Retrospective analysis complete
- Scaling relationships characterized (if any)
- Future research directions identified

## Mechanistic Hypotheses

### **M‚ÇÅ: Decorrelation Mechanism** (Both Domains)

**Hypothesis**: Quasiperiodic mixing reduces temporal autocorrelation in the computational process, preventing premature convergence (DTQC) or systematic bias accumulation (QBG).

**Observable Predictions**:
1. Autocorrelation function decays faster with quasiperiodicity
2. DTQC: Parameter space coverage (convex hull volume) increases by ‚â•30%
3. QBG: Bitstream randomness (entropy rate) increases by ‚â•20%
4. Both: Revisitation probability decreases

**Measurement**:
```python
# DTQC
acf_static = autocorr(fitness_trajectory_static)
acf_qp = autocorr(fitness_trajectory_solar_lunar)
assert acf_qp[lag=1] < 0.5 * acf_static[lag=1]

# QBG  
acf_single = autocorr(bitstream_single_lfsr)
acf_dual = autocorr(bitstream_qbg)
assert acf_dual[lag=1] < 0.5 * acf_single[lag=1]
```

**Falsification**: Autocorrelation unchanged (ratio > 0.8) or increased

**Test During**: H‚ÇÅ and H‚ÇÇ primary experiments

---

### **M‚ÇÇ: Resonance with Natural Dynamics** (DTQC-specific)

**Hypothesis**: For DTQC, the improvement requires resonance between external forcing periods and internal circadian rhythms. This is domain-specific and does NOT apply to QBG.

**Observable Predictions**:
1. Circadian-coupled model shows 15-25% improvement
2. Circadian-disabled model shows <5% improvement
3. Optimal performance at specific beat phases
4. Solar-only and Lunar-only individually show 5-10% improvement (single-period resonance exists)

**Measurement**:
```python
# Compare coupled vs decoupled
improvement_coupled = (fitness_coupled_qp - fitness_coupled_static) / fitness_coupled_static
improvement_decoupled = (fitness_decoupled_qp - fitness_decoupled_static) / fitness_decoupled_static

assert improvement_coupled > 0.15
assert improvement_decoupled < 0.05
```

**Falsification**: Decoupled model shows equal improvement (>15%)

**Domain Note**: This mechanism is SPECIFIC to biological systems with circadian clocks. QBG operates purely on mathematical decorrelation (M‚ÇÅ).

**Test During**: H‚ÇÅ experiments (include circadian-disabled condition as control)

---

### **M‚ÇÉ: Multi-Scale Energy Landscape Navigation** (Exploratory)

**Hypothesis**: Multiple incommensurate periods MAY create multi-scale perturbations that help escape local minima at different timescales. This is speculative.

**Observable Predictions** (if H‚ÇÉ pursued):
1. Single-period forcing escapes "fast" local minima only
2. Two-period forcing escapes fast + medium minima
3. Three-period forcing escapes fast + medium + slow minima

**Measurement**:
- Basin of attraction analysis via perturbation sensitivity
- Time-to-escape from synthetic local minima
- Final fitness distributions (multimodality)
- Spectral analysis of fitness trajectories

**Falsification**: No relationship between number of periods and escape from local minima

**Status**: Will only be tested if H‚ÇÉ is pursued (conditional on H‚ÇÅ and H‚ÇÇ showing >20% improvements)

---
