# Testable Hypothesis: Quasiperiodic Bitstream Generation

## Research Question

Can dual-LFSR quasiperiodic mixing, inspired by the mathematical principles of discrete time quasicrystals, reduce correlation artifacts and improve accuracy in stochastic computing operations?

---

## Hypothesis Statement

**Primary Hypothesis (H1):**
> Stochastic multiplication and addition operations using bitstreams generated from two LFSRs with incommensurate periods, mixed quasiperiodically, will exhibit **10-30% lower error** compared to operations using bitstreams from a single LFSR, when measured over 1000 trials with 256-bit streams.

**Null Hypothesis (H0):**
> There is no statistically significant difference in error rates between single-LFSR and dual-LFSR quasiperiodic bitstream generation for stochastic computing operations.

**Secondary Hypothesis (H2):**
> The autocorrelation function of quasiperiodically-mixed dual-LFSR bitstreams will show **at least 20% lower peak autocorrelation** (excluding zero lag) compared to single-LFSR bitstreams.

## Measurement Protocol

### Error Measurement
```python
def measure_error(method, P_A, P_B, operation='multiply', trials=1000):
    errors = []
    for trial in range(trials):
        # Generate bitstreams
        stream_A = method.generate(P_A, length=256)
        stream_B = method.generate(P_B, length=256)
        
        # Perform operation
        if operation == 'multiply':
            result_stream = bitwise_and(stream_A, stream_B)
            expected = P_A * P_B
        elif operation == 'add':
            result_stream = mux_add(stream_A, stream_B)
            expected = 0.5 * (P_A + P_B)
        
        # Measure result
        measured = count_ones(result_stream) / 256
        errors.append(abs(measured - expected))
    
    return {
        'mean_error': np.mean(errors),
        'std_error': np.std(errors),
        'max_error': np.max(errors),
        'min_error': np.min(errors)
    }
```

### Autocorrelation Measurement
```python
def measure_autocorrelation(bitstream):
    """
    Compute normalized autocorrelation
    Return peak value excluding lag=0
    """
    autocorr = np.correlate(bitstream, bitstream, mode='full')
    autocorr = autocorr / autocorr[len(bitstream)-1]  # Normalize
    
    # Remove zero lag (always 1.0)
    middle = len(autocorr) // 2
    autocorr = np.delete(autocorr, middle)
    
    return np.max(np.abs(autocorr))
```

## Falsification Criteria

**Abandon hypothesis if:**

1. ‚ùå Mean error reduction < 5% across all parameter combinations
2. ‚ùå No statistical significance (p > 0.1) in any test
3. ‚ùå High variance makes results unreproducible
4. ‚ùå Computational overhead > 3x vs single LFSR
5. ‚ùå Hardware implementation shows opposite effect (worse accuracy)

**Note:** Negative results are still publishable! Title becomes: "Limits of Quasiperiodic Mixing for Stochastic Computing: An Empirical Study"

## Intellectual Honesty Checklist

Before claiming results, verify:

- [ ] Statistical tests appropriate and correctly applied
- [ ] P-hacking avoided (no selective reporting)
- [ ] Effect sizes reported, not just p-values
- [ ] Confidence intervals included
- [ ] Negative results disclosed if found
- [ ] Limitations section honest and complete
- [ ] No overstating "DTQC" connection (mathematical inspiration only)
- [ ] Hardware validation confirms simulation
- [ ] Independent reproduction attempted
- [ ] Data and code publicly available

## Lean 4 Formal Verification Component

Regardless of empirical results, formalize in Lean:

```lean
-- Theorem: Dual LFSR autocorrelation bound
theorem dual_lfsr_autocorrelation_bound
  (lfsr1 lfsr2 : LFSR)
  (h_incommensurate : Irrational (lfsr1.period / lfsr2.period))
  (mixing : ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù) :
  ‚àÉ (bound : ‚Ñù), bound < single_lfsr_autocorr ‚àß
    quasiperiodic_autocorr lfsr1 lfsr2 mixing ‚â§ bound
```

This provides theoretical foundation even if empirical gains are modest.
