# Stochastic Computing REPL Core ⚡

An innovative **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)** for stochastic computing operations, where every computation is backed by **formal mathematical verification**. This project combines the exploratory power of interactive programming with the certainty of proven mathematics, enabling trustworthy experimentation with probabilistic hardware computing.

## What is a REPL? 🔄

A **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive programming environment that:
- **Reads** user input (commands)
- **Evaluates** those commands (executes code)
- **Prints** the results
- **Loops** back for the next command

Traditional REPLs like Python's `python3` or Lisp's REPL enable exploratory programming. Our innovation: a REPL where "Eval" performs **stochastic computing operations** on actual FPGA hardware, with every operation mathematically verified for correctness.

## What is Stochastic Computing? 🎲

**Stochastic computing** represents numbers as probabilities in bitstreams:
- `0.5` = exactly 128 ones in a 256-bit stream
- `0.25` = exactly 64 ones in a 256-bit stream
- Operations use simple logic gates instead of complex arithmetic circuits

**Key insight**: Trade precision for hardware simplicity
- **Multiplication**: Just an AND gate! `P(A ∧ B) = P(A) × P(B)`
- **Addition**: A multiplexer (MUX) circuit
- **No complex multipliers or adders needed**

This enables ultra-low-power, area-efficient computing perfect for edge devices and IoT.

## The REPL Core Architecture 🏗️

"Core" here means the **fundamental evaluation engine** (not CPU cores). Our REPL follows the classic pattern but with stochastic operations:

```
User Command → Parse → Execute on FPGA → Convert Result → Display
     ↑                                                            ↓
   Read                                                        Print
     ↓                                                            ↑
   Eval ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← Loop
```

- **Read**: Parse commands like `load a 128`, `mul`, `print r`
- **Eval**: Execute stochastic operations on Tang Nano 9K FPGA hardware
- **Print**: Convert bitstream results to human-readable probabilities
- **Loop**: Return to read state for next command

## System Components with Verification Stack 🔍

Our system builds trust through **layered verification** - from mathematical theorems to working hardware:

### Lean 4 - Formal Verification (Development Time) 📐
**Proves stochastic operations are mathematically correct for ALL cases**
- Example: Proves that `P(A ∧ B) = P(A) × P(B)` for independent bitstreams
- Verifies AND gates really multiply, MUX circuits really add
- Establishes error bounds and convergence rates for different bitstream lengths
- **Critical for trust**: Users can rely on results because the math is proven sound
- Unlike tests (which check specific cases), Lean proves correctness universally

### Verilog - Hardware Implementation (Tang Nano 9K FPGA) 🔧
**Implements the verified algorithms in actual hardware**
- LFSR-based Stochastic Number Generator (SNG)

#### Performance Trade-offs: Speed vs. Power

**FPGA Alone (High Speed):**
- Clock rates: 100-200 MHz
- Operation time: Microseconds per computation
- Power: 50-200 mW
- **Best for**: Real-time applications, high-throughput processing

**FPGA + CMOS (Ultra-Low Power):**
- CMOS speed: 1-10 MHz (slower gates)
- Operation time: Milliseconds per computation (longer bitstreams)
- Power: 0.0002 mW (500,000x more efficient!)
- **Best for**: Battery-powered devices, educational validation, research

**Key Insight**: Stochastic computing prioritizes **accuracy over speed**
- Uses long bitstreams (256-1024 bits) for precision
- CMOS validates Lean theorems in real silicon
- FPGA provides fast control and data movement

#### When to Use Each Approach

**Use FPGA Alone:**

- When power consumption isn't critical
- Development and testing

**Use FPGA + CMOS:**
- Ultra-low-power applications (IoT, sensors, wearables)
- Educational demonstrations of CMOS LSI design
- Hardware validation of formal verification
- Research into probabilistic computing
- Battery-powered stochastic systems

**Hybrid Benefits:**
- FPGA handles complex control and high-speed I/O
- CMOS performs ultra-efficient stochastic computations
- Best of both worlds: speed + efficiency

## The Verification Philosophy 🏛️

```
Lean 4 Theorems          →  "Multiplication SHOULD work this way"
       ↓
Verilog Implementation   →  "Here's the actual hardware"
       ↓
Python Tests            →  "Does it match the theory?"
       ↓
REPL Interface          →  User experiments interactively
```

When you type `mul`, you can **trust** the result because:
- ✅ Lean proved the algorithm is mathematically sound (development time)
- ✅ Verilog implemented it correctly in hardware
- ✅ Tests verified implementation matches proof
- ✅ The REPL orchestrates the verified operations (runtime)

## Why Formal Verification Matters 🤔

**Tests show it works for specific cases. Lean proves it works for ALL cases.**

- **Hardware is expensive to fix** - once fabricated, you can't patch bugs
- **Probabilistic computing needs certainty** - users must trust statistical results
- **Mathematical guarantees** about error bounds and accuracy
- **Builds confidence** in experimental probabilistic systems

Without formal verification, stochastic computing remains "experimental." With it, becomes a trustworthy foundation for probabilistic hardware.

## Example Session 🎮

```
> load a 128    # Load 0.5 into register a (128/256 = 0.5)
> load b 64     # Load 0.25 into register b (64/256 = 0.25)
> mul           # Evaluate: stochastic multiplication on FPGA (Lean-verified)
> print r       # Print result: ~0.125 (0.5 × 0.25 = 0.125)
```

The beauty: you're not just getting a number - you're getting a **mathematically proven correct** result from probabilistic hardware!
