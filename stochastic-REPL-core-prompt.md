A stochastic computing REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) core is a theoretical or research-stage computer processing unit (CPU) that would perform computations using streams of random or pseudo-random bits rather than traditional binary logic, and would have an interactive command-line interface
. This design is not currently available commercially, but it's an area of academic research into future energy-efficient and fault-tolerant processors for specific applications. 
Core concepts
A stochastic computing REPL core would combine two advanced computer science concepts:
Stochastic computing (SC)

    Data representation: SC represents numerical values as bitstreams, where the value is the probability of a "1" occurring. For instance, a stream with a 75% chance of a "1" represents the value 0.75.
    Simplified arithmetic: Complex operations are performed with extremely simple logic gates. A single AND gate can perform multiplication, while a multiplexer (MUX) can perform scaled addition. This reduces circuit size and power consumption significantly.
    Fault tolerance: Since information is spread across a stream of bits, single-bit errors have a negligible effect on the final result, making the architecture highly resilient to noise.
    Progressive precision: A rough estimate of the result is available almost immediately, with accuracy improving as more bits are processed.
    Challenges: The main drawbacks are the long bitstreams required for high precision, which increases latency, and the hardware overhead of generating and managing uncorrelated random bitstreams. 

REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
A REPL is an interactive programming environment that takes a single user input, evaluates it, and returns the result to the user. A stochastic REPL core would enable this type of interaction directly on the stochastic hardware. 
How a stochastic computing REPL core might function
Combining these two concepts would create a system that operates very differently from a conventional CPU:

    Read (input): A user would input a value or function to the REPL via a terminal. This binary data would first be converted into a stochastic bitstream by a Stochastic Number Generator (SNG).
    Evaluate (execute): The core would contain simple stochastic logic circuits (AND gates, MUXes, etc.) to perform the required computation on the bitstreams. This computation would be inherently approximate but highly parallel and low-power.
    Print (output): Once the operation is complete (or a desired level of accuracy is reached), the resulting output bitstream would be converted back into a binary number using a simple counter.
    Loop: The system returns the binary result to the user, who can then enter the next command. 

## Project Implementation

This project will implement the stochastic computing REPL core using the following technologies:

- **Hardware Platform**: ELM11 controller with REPL cores, integrated with the Tang Nano 9K FPGA for prototyping and testing.
- **Programming Language**: Lean v4 will be used as much as possible for formal specification, theorem proving, and code generation to ensure correctness and reliability of the stochastic computations.
